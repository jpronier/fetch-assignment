# Email to stakeholders:


Hi, 

I hope that you're doing well. 

As I am currently working on the Rewards Project, my analysis reveals that I would need further information about the data to be able to move forward. 

By searching for missing information, checking for incoherence and looking at inconsistencies, I have identified several data quality issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, I found important values missing, duplicate records and unexpected outliers. For example, our information on our customers has a lot of repetition and some values are missing. This is essential to resolve to ensure key metrics like customer retention are accurate. I identified similar issues in our products related data.
To address these issues, I would need to know more about the following points: 
- What are the key business goals associated with this dataset?
- When is a user still considered active? What is the typical update frequency for this dataset?
- Given the high number of missing values, could you provide more context around how this data is collected and any existing validation processes?


Also, as I work to optimize the data assets for the project, I would like to ensure they are tailored to meet your teamâ€™s needs effectively. 
Hence, could you provide a bit more detail on the following:
- Access and reporting requirements
- Data refresh frequency
- Privacy or security considerations

Finally, I would like to share performance and scaling concerns for the future of the project:
- Do we anticipate any high data growth? Has there been a marketing campaign recently?
- Do we expect any requirements for real-time or near-real-time data access? An according infrastructure would be needed such as response times would remain low.


Thank you for your time and understanding.


Best Regards,

Julie Pronier
